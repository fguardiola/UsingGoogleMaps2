        This application was developed as a final project of studies performed in Institute of Technology of Tallaght within the Higher Diploma in Computing course.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is a web application that connects pubs and restaurants owners and users to share deals.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this way a registered pub owner can register pubs, attach new deals to them, have information about vouchers sold among other things.
    </p>
    <p>
        A normal user can search for deals by establishing criteria search, access to information of deals and proceed with his purchase if he is interested through the PayPal payment platform integrated into the system.
